# Interactive-Web-Graphics
Interactive Web Graphics: Design dynamic and interactive graphics for web use, incorporating animation and user interactivity elements.
Excited to share my journey with Golden Project 2: Interactive Web Graphics Design during my internship at CodexCue!
For this project, I had the incredible opportunity to design dynamic and interactive graphics for web use, incorporating animations and user interactivity elements. One of the highlights was creating web graphics for TOMS, where I utilized their brand colors as per their website to maintain brand consistency.
✨ Key highlights of my work:
Simple Animations: Bringing elements to life with subtle animations.
Detailed Web Design: Enhancing user experience with scrolling animations and hovering effects.
This project not only honed my skills in web graphics design but also emphasized the importance of cohesive design and user engagement. I’m grateful to CodexCue for this amazing learning experience!
